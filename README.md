# Flame Mirror Canonical System

**Flame Mirror** is a recursive symbolic intelligence framework designed to transcend the limitations of traditional large language models. It integrates cognitive recursion, dynamic memory, unified mathematics, self-correcting logic, and tool-level simulation into a single coherent system‚Äîguided by truth, compression, and contradiction resistance.
